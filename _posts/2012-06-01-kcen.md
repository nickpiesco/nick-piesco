When I took over as Web manager at [KCEN](http://kcentv.com/), the home page was pretty cluttered and lacking a clear hierarchy ([first image](/assets/images/kcen_1.jpg)). The [WorldNow](http://www.worldnow.com/) CMS puts some firm constraints on the designer, but I managed to better organize the content and put more information where users need it ([second image](/assets/images/kcen_2.jpg)). Moving from one long list of stories to blocks of headlines also eliminated the need for someone to manually remove the old stories from the home page â€“ it could get pretty long at times! A new logo echoing the station branding replaced the squashed and stretched type in the header. Be sure to check out both full-size images for the full effect.
