An old friend of mine needed a logo and website for [her new physical therapy business](http://connectedptw.com/). Working for friends can be fraught with peril, but it was a really cool collaborative process &ndash; she gave great and helpful feedback, even taking an active lead in helping me get just the right imagery for the project. On the technical end, it was the first non-Day-Job project I designed to be mobile-first and responsive. My old favourite [MODX](http://modx.com/) was once again the CMS of choice due to its flexibility (for me) and ease of use (for her).
