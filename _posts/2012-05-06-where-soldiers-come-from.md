A static HTML site for this independent documentary was my first ‘real world’ project as I began my journey into Web design and development several years ago. As the film got wider distribution (including [airing on PBS](http://www.pbs.org/pov/wheresoldierscomefrom/)), it needed a touch-up to match the poster and DVD art that didn't exist when the site first launched. This was a golden opportunity to move it to a CMS; so I chose WordPress, because that’s what everybody uses, right?

I toyed with the idea of building a child theme on top of a theme framework, but it seemed like kind of overkill for what's really a fairly uncomplicated layout. So I fired up [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/) at my side, and away I went! I used [Matt Mullenweg’s old reliable image rotator script](http://ma.tt/scripts/randomimage/) (with an additional nugget of cache-busting PHP) to rotate the images on the inside pages and [the Black Studio TinyMCE Widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/) to make it easy for the client to spiff up the text widget in the sidebar.
